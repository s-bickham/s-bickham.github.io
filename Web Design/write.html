    <h1>Bull News - HTML News Aricle - Band Buddies</h1>

<p>A couple weeks ago I had gotten a message from my friend Wyatt who I’d meet last year saying <q>Yo. You should join this new band I'm making with a couple people. </q> In this band would be <i>me, Wyatt, Vera, Fiona, and Lacy </i>. I since I’ve met them last year, we had become friends, and all played some sort of instrument. Before this we had started another band but with way more people. It didn't really work out though because there was some hostility between some people in the group and not everyone got to play. Eventually people started leaving and no one made plans anymore</p> 

<p>The first time we met up for this new band was fun and way more productive than any of our previous meets with our old one. We figured out roles and who's going to play what and started working on a song. I would be playing Acoustic Guitar, Wyatt on drums, Vera, bass and guitar, and Lacy and Fiona on guitar. After that we started to work on a song, we don't have a name for it yet, but we’ve figured out chords. Second time around Fiona couldn’t make it so we mostly just reviewed and played songs we’ve listened on our instruments. </p> 

		<p>Last time we met was last week where Vera decided to bring her boyfriend Apollo. I've met Apollo before, and we used to talk but it has been a couple years. Since Fiona was gone again, we mostly just hung out playing songs and chilled in her hammocks. Apparently, he's joining our band now, I don't know what he plays but i feel like the band is getting a bit big. Hopefully we meet soon again and work more on the song. Being that I just started playing almost a year ago and has the chance to play in a band with my friends is pretty great. </p>
